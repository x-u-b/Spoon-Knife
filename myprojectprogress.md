I would like to work on a project that deals with maintaining some kind of
database and developing tools that would make for easy querying/searching.
It would be best to use a blessed repository when working in a group because
it provides a saftey net for bugs that may appear when adding to the project.
The blessed repository always has a correct version of the code that you can
come back to if your work becomes too messy.
